/**
 * Represents the game server that manages the game state and client interactions.
 *
 * The GameServer class follows the Observer design pattern, where multiple ClientHandler objects
 * (acting as observers) observe the game server and receive updates when the game state changes.
 * The server manages the grid, player state, and overall game flow. It broadcasts state changes to
 * all registered observers, ensuring that clients remain in sync with the server's actions (e.g.,
 * player movements, game status updates).
 *
 * The GameServer also manages player assignments, ensuring that players are added or removed as necessary,
 * and that the game starts only when all players are ready.
